It was a very short time to include all the necessary components of a web API 
These are the changes I would have done, If I had time.

Adding ILogger to all controllers 
Global Exception handling
Implementing different repo's for each entity
Adding Model validations
Adding Unit tests with Mocking
Adding Automapper.
There are some spelling mistake's in stored procedures.
I would have used EF linq's instead of stored procedures.
Instead of stored procedures use entity framework. Need to have the testable logic at one place.
I would have used CQRS + Mediator pattern if I had time -> CQRS make microservice friendly and Mediator is for separation of concerns.I will add some complexity but add it worth.
